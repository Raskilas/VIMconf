# VIMconf

My config file with some plugins.

### Useful commands:

- in Insert mode **Ctrl-O<command>** - executes command in Insert mode. Could be useful in some cases: **Ctrl-Odd** - remove all line, **Ctrl-Ow** - move one word further and etc..
- **H**, **M**, **L** - move cursor to **H**igh/Top, **M**iddle and **L**ow/Bottom of the screen respectively. 
- **<Ctrl>-b**, **<Ctrl>-f** - **PgUp** and **PgDn** respectively.
- **<Ctrl>-e**, **<Ctrl>-y** - move screen down and up by one line respectively. One line scroll.
- **_** - jump to the first non-whitespace character in the line.
- **%** - move to matching character: (), {}, [].
- **e**, **E** - the same as **w**, **W** but moves cursor to the end of word.
- **Ctrl-r** - redo.
- **Ctrl-s**, **Ctrl-q** - **S**top and **Q/C**ontinue terminal. [Flow control](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/12146)
- **"0p** - paste the last **y**anked word. **"** - get data from register, **0** - register always store the last yanked word, **p** - paste after cursor.
- **"+p** - paste from Linux's system buffer. The same as **Ctrl-Shift-V** in bash.
- **"\*p** - paste from Windows's system buffer. Or paste from Linux's mouse *right-click>copy* buffer.
- **q<a-z><commands>q** - record macros in register **<a-z>**. Registers **<0-9>**, **-** and **=** may and will be overwritten due text editing(xXcCdDyYsS commands), so don't use then for macros.
- **@<a-z>**, **<n>@<a-z>**, **@@** - execute macros in register **<a-z>**, execute **<n>** times macros in register **<a-z>**, repeat last executed macros.



- **Ctrl+[** - open Normal mode. The same as **Esc** button.
- **ZZ** - save document and quit Vim. But as for me **:wq** is more comfortable.
- **zz**, **zt**, **zb** - text scroll. Move line with cursor to **z/C**enter, to **T**op and **B**ottom of screen respectively.
- **Ctrl+u**, **Ctrl+d** - move screen on half of page **U**p and **D**own.
- **ciw** - remove whole current word no matter on which character cursor point and enable Insert mode. **C**hange **I**nside **W**ord.

- **/foo<Enter>cgnbar<Esc>** then **n.** - quick search of **foo** and replace with **bar**. **n** - **n**ext search appearance, **.** - insert previously typed **bar**.
- **\*cwbar<Esc>** then **n.** - quick search variation of previous commands, but in this case we assume that cursor is already point to the start of word to be replaced.
- **:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gcI** - case sensitive find **foo** and replace with **bar** with confirmation. **%** - in all lines, **\\<** and **\\>** - only whole word exactly matching **foo**, **bar** - replace with that word, **g** - **g**lobal for line (all appearance, not only first), **c** - **C**onfirmation, ask for confirmation on every appearance (y/n/a/q/l/^E/^Y - **y**es/**n**o/**a**ll/**q**uit/change **l**ast one and quit/scroll screen up/scroll screen down), **I** - case sensitive - opposite to **i** - case **i**nsensitive. **%** can be replaced with range of line numbers **:5,12s/foo/bar/g** (from 5 to 12 inclusive), with marks **:'a,'bs/foo/bar/g** (from **a**-mark to **b**-mark), with offset **:.,+2s/foo/bar/g** (from **.** - current line to **+2** lines below) or **:.,$s/foo/bar/g** (from current line to the **$** - end of file).
- **:noh** - **no h**ighlight/disable search results.
